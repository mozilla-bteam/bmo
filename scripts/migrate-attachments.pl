Syntax:
    migrate-attachments.pl --mirror source destination
    migrate-attachments.pl --copy source destination
    migrate-attachments.pl --delete source

'mirror'
    Copies all attachments from the specified source to the destination.
    Attachments which already exist at the destination will not be copied
    again. Attachments deleted on the source will be deleted from the
    destination.

    eg. migrate-attachments.pl --mirror database s3

'copy'
    Copies all attachments from the specified source to the destination.
    Attachments which already exist at the destination will not be copied
    again. Unlike 'mirror', attachments deleted from the source will not be
    removed from the destination.

    eg. migrate-attachments.pl --copy database s3

'delete'
    Deletes all attachments in the specified location.  This operation cannot
    be undone.

    eg. migrate-attachments.pl --delete database

Valid locations:
    @storage_names
