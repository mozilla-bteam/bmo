Usage: syncmsandversions.pl <srcproduct> <tgtproduct>

E.g.: syncmsandversions.pl FoodReplicator SeaMonkey
will copy any versions and milstones in the product "FoodReplicator"
which do not exist in product "SeaMonkey" into it. This script is normally
used prior to moving components from srcproduct to tgtproduct.
