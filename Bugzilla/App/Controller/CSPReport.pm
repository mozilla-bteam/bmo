# Collector for Content-Security-Policy violation reports.
#
# This is a temporary aid for the CSP-enforcement rollout: while the legacy
# CGI pages remain in report-only mode, browsers POST a JSON report here for
# every violation. Aggregating them
# server-side lets us build an inventory of what would break under enforcement
# without relying on someone watching the DevTools console on every page.
#
# Only the report-uri wire format is handled: that is the only reporting
# directive DEFAULT_CSP emits. We deliberately do not parse the Reporting API
# ("report-to") batch format, since nothing sets a Reporting-Endpoints header,
# and accepting an array of reports would let a single request produce an
# unbounded number of log lines.
#
# Each report is written to the application log twice over: as MozLog "Fields"
# entries, so the inventory can be built with structured tooling (jq, the GCP
# logging console), and as a flat summary line tagged "CSP-VIOLATION" for
# grepping. Once all legacy pages are clean and CSP is enforced globally, both
# this controller and the report_uri directive in DEFAULT_CSP can be removed.

# Untrusted report values are written to a single log line, so cap their length
# to keep log volume bounded and strip control characters to defeat multi-line
# log injection.
