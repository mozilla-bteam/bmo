Profanivore 'eats' English profanities in comments, leaving behind instead a
trail of droppings ('****'). It finds its food using a standard library Perl
regexp. The profanity is only eaten where the comment was written by a user
who does not have the global 'editbugs' privilege. The digestion happens at
display time, so the comment in the database is unaltered.

However, it does not eat profanities when showing people their own comments;
the aim here is to prevent people immediately noticing they are being
censored, and getting 'creative'.

The purpose of Profanivore is to make it a little harder for trolls to
vandalise public Bugzilla installations.

It does not currently affect fields other than comments.
