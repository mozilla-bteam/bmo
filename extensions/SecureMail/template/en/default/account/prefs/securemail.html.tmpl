<p>Some [% terms.bugs %] in this [% terms.Bugzilla %] are in groups the administrator has
deemed 'secure'. This means emails containing information about those [% terms.bugs %]
will only be sent encrypted. Enter your PGP/GPG public key or
SMIME certificate here to receive full update emails for such [% terms.bugs %].</p>

<p>If you are a member of a secure group, or if you enter a key here, your password reset email will also be sent to you encrypted. If you are a member of a secure group and do not enter a key, you will not be able to reset your password without the assistance of an administrator.</p>
