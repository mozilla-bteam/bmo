    Unfortunately, we need to keep [% terms.bugs %] in the Legal product
    restricted to employees, in order to preserve attorney-client privilege and
    protect confidentiality.  Due to the way [% terms.Bugzilla %] works, this
    means we can't let you file such [% terms.abug %] yourself. However, you
    can contact Mozilla Legal through either legal-notices@mozilla.com or
    trademarks@mozilla.com, as appropriate.
