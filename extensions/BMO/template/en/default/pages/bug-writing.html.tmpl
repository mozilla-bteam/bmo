<p>If you&apos;re new to reporting [% terms.bugs %], you may want to try getting help from the more experienced
  contributors. If you&apos;re going to report a Firefox [% terms.bug %], you can also get assistance in the
  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!IzVMcpFSIBAkaCECOW:mozilla.org?via=mozilla.org">#fx-desktop-community room
  </a>on <a href="https://chat.mozilla.org">Mozilla Matrix server</a>. For a list of other projects

<h3 id="Open_a_new_bug_report_for_each_issue!">Open a new [% terms.bug %] report for each issue!</h3>

<p>So an effective [% terms.bug %] fix workflow will be completed for each issue.</p>

<h3 id="Other_details_you_should_heed">Other details you should heed</h3>

<ol>
 <li>Figure out the <strong>steps to reproduce a [% terms.bug %]</strong>:

  <ul>
   <li>If you have <a href="#Writing_precise_steps_to_reproduce">precise steps to reproduce</a>
     — great! — you&apos;re on your way to reporting a useful [% terms.bug %] report.</li>
   <li>If you can reproduce occasionally, but not after following specific steps, you must provide
     <a href="#specific-types">additional information</a> for the [% terms.bug %] to be useful.</li>
   <li>If you can&apos;t reproduce the problem, there&apos;s probably no use in reporting it, unless
     you provide unique information about its occurrence.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Make sure your software is up to date. Ideally, test an in-development version to see whether
   your [% terms.bug %] has already been fixed (e.g. <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/channel/">
   Firefox Beta, Aurora</a>, or bleeding-edge <a class="link-https" href="https://nightly.mozilla.org/">
   Nightly</a>).</li>
 <li>When reporting a Firefox [% terms.bug %], first check if you can reproduce the [% terms.bug %] in a
   <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles">
   new Firefox profile</a>. If the [% terms.bug %] only happens in your existing profile, try to figure out what
   <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-extensions-themes-to-fix-problems">
   settings, extensions</a>, or <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data">
   files in your profile</a> are needed to reproduce the [% terms.bug %].
   <ul>
     <li>If the [% terms.bug %] seems egregious (i.e. obviously affecting a large portion of users), there&apos;s
       probably something unusual about your setup that&apos;s a necessary part of the steps to reproduce
       the [% terms.bug %]. You have much better chances of figuring it out than a developer who does not have access
       to your system.</li>
     <li>If the [% terms.bug %] falls into one of <a href="#specific-types">specific types of [% terms.bugs %] listed in a section
       below</a>, it may still be useful even if you can&apos;t reproduce it in a new Firefox profile.</li>
   </ul></li>
 <li>Open the <a class="link-https" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?format=guided">
   Enter a new [% terms.bug %]</a> form, which will guide you through most of the [% terms.bug %] reporting process:
   <ul>
     <li>Create a [% terms.Bugzilla %]  account if you don&apos;t have one already, select the product having the [% terms.bug %].</li>
     <li>Enter a <strong>clear unique summary</strong> as <a href="#Writing_a_clear_summary">described below</a>;
       check if the [% terms.bug %] has already been reported (if you want to be more thorough, there&apos;s an advanced guide
       on <a href="/en-US/docs/Screening_duplicate_bugs">screening duplicate [% terms.bugs %]</a>).</li>
     <li>Provide <strong>precise steps to reproduce</strong>, <strong>expected results</strong> and <strong>actual
       results</strong> as <a href="#Writing_precise_steps_to_reproduce">described in the following section</a>.</li>
     <li>Provide additional information (also <a href="#Providing_additional_information">described below</a>),
       especially if you can&apos;t reproduce the [% terms.bug %] in a new profile; and/or by reporting a <strong>crash</strong>,
       <strong>memory usage</strong>, <strong>performance</strong>, <strong>regression</strong> [% terms.bug %]; or if the
       problem is with a specific web site.</li>
   </ul></li>
 <li>If you have multiple issues, please file separate [% terms.bug %] reports.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Writing_a_clear_summary">Writing a clear summary</h2>

<p>How would you describe the [% terms.bug %] using approximately 10 words? This is the first part of your [% terms.bug %] report a
  triager or developer will see.</p>

<p>A good summary should quickly and uniquely identify a [% terms.bug %] report. It should explain the problem,
  not your suggested solution.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Good: &quot;Cancelling a File Copy dialog crashes File Manager&quot;</li>
 <li>Bad: &quot;Software crashes&quot;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li>Good: &quot;Down-arrow scrolling doesn&apos;t work in &lt;textarea&gt; styled with overflow:hidden&quot;</li>
 <li>Bad: &quot;Browser should work with my web site&quot;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Writing_precise_steps_to_reproduce">Writing precise steps to reproduce</h2>

<p>How can a developer reproduce the [% terms.bug %] on his or her own computer?</p>

<p>Steps to reproduce are the <strong>most important part of any [% terms.bug %] report</strong>. If a developer is able
  to reproduce the [% terms.bug %], the [% terms.bug %] is very likely to be fixed. If the steps are unclear, it might not even be
  possible to know whether the [% terms.bug %] has been fixed.</p>

<h3 id="Finding_the_correct_product_and_component" name="Finding_the_correct_product_and_component">
  <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Finding the correct product and component</strong></h3>

<p>You will be asked to categorize your [% terms.bug %] into a &quot;product&quot; and a &quot;component&quot; within
  that product, in order to direct your report to the correct developers.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re using Firefox, the [% terms.bug %] is most likely in &quot;Firefox&quot;, &quot;Toolkit&quot;, or &quot;Core&quot;.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="link-https" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=Firefox">
    List of components in the &quot;Firefox&quot; product</a> - Most parts of Firefox that you interact with directly</li>
  <li><a class="link-https" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=Toolkit">
    List of components in the &quot;Toolkit&quot; product</a> - Interface widgets and some frontend features</li>
  <li><a class="link-https" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=Core">
    List of components in the &quot;Core&quot; product</a> - Web page rendering, networking, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>When in doubt, search for similar [% terms.bugs %] and see which component they are in.</p>

<p>If none of the components seem appropriate, look for a &quot;General&quot; component in the most appropriate product.</p>

<h3 id="General_Outline_of_a_Bug_Report">General Outline of a [% terms.bug %] Report</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Summary</strong>: How would you describe the [% terms.bug %] in less than 60 characters?
    It should quickly and uniquely identify a [% terms.bug %] report as well as explain the problem, not your
    suggested solution. Good: &quot;Canceling a File Copy dialog crashes File Manager&quot; Bad:
    &quot;Software crashes&quot; Bad: &quot;Browser should work with my web site&quot;</li>
  <li><strong>Component</strong>: In which sub-part of the software does it exist? This field is a
    requirement to submit any [% terms.bug %] report. Click the word &quot;Component&quot; to see a description
    of each component. If none seems appropriate, highlight the &quot;General&quot; component.</li>
  <li><a name="version"> </a><strong>Version</strong>: select the earliest Version with what the problem can be reproduced:
    <ul>
      <li>Developers will use that information to narrow down the commit what introduced a regression</li>
      <li>QA staff needs that information to distinguish [% terms.bugs %] with similar symptoms, but different roots.
        <ul>
          <li>[% terms.bugs %] that definitively appeared in different <em>Product</em> <em>Versions</em> probably will have different roots</li>
          <li>But [% terms.bugs %] that started with the same <em>Product</em> <em>Version</em> probably are DUPLICATEs</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>Trunk</em> does not allow any useful query. We have <em>Trunk</em> version [% terms.bugs %] from
        beginning of the project until today, no common characteristics at all what can be tagged with
        this version. Avoid Trunk, replace it by precise information with what version the problem appeared if you can.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>OS</strong>: On which operating system (OS) did you find it? (E.g. Linux, Windows, and Mac.)
    Example: &quot;<em>If you know the [% terms.bug %] happens on more than one type of operating system, choose
    &quot;All&quot;. If your OS isn&apos;t listed, choose Other&quot;.</em></li>
  <li><strong>Description</strong>: The details of your problem report, including:
    <ul>
      <li><u>Overview</u>: This is a larger detailed restatement of the summary. An example would be:
        <em>&quot;Drag-selecting any page crashes Mac builds in the NSGetFactory function&quot;</em>.</li>
      <li><u>Build Id</u>: To find this either go to the &quot;about:support&quot; page via the location bar
        or, if you have MozQA&apos;s <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nightly-tester-tools/">
        Nightly Tester Tools</a> extension, then go to Tools | Nightly Tester Tools and select the option that
        contains the output of the build Id. It should look something like this: <em>&quot;Mozilla/5.0
        (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.10; rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0 ID:20150330004006 CSet:
        9e57e9776571&quot;</em>.</li>
      <li><u>Additional Builds and Platforms</u>: Whether or not the [% terms.bug %] takes place on other platforms
        (or browsers, if applicable). It should look something like this: <em>&quot;Doesn&apos;t Occur
        On Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.10; rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0 ID:20150330004006 CSet:
        9e57e9776571&quot;</em>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Steps to Reproduce</strong>: Minimized, easy-to-follow steps that will trigger the [% terms.bug %].
    If they&apos;re necessary, make sure to include any special setup steps. A good example of this would
    look like the following:<br>
    1) View any web page. (I used the default sample page, http://www.google.com/).<br>
    2) Drag-select the page. Specifically, while holding down the mouse button, drag the mouse pointer
       downwards from any point in the browser&apos;s content region to the bottom of the browser&apos;s content region.</li>
  <li><strong>Actual Results</strong>: What the application did after performing the above steps.
    An example would be: <em>The application crashed.</em></li>
  <li><strong>Expected Results</strong>: What the application should have done, were the [% terms.bug %] not present.
    An example would be: <em>The window should scroll downwards. Scrolled content should be selected.
    Or, at least, the application should not crash.</em></li>
</ul>
