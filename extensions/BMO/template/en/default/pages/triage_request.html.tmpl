      Thank you.

    <p>
      With your help sorting and triaging [% terms.bugs %] Mozilla will be able
      to ship a better product to hundreds of millions of users that much
      faster.

    <p>
      Triage is the first step in a [% terms.bug %]'s road to resolution; having
      'canconfirm' rights gives you the access you'll need to help move that [%
      terms.bug %] it into the right component, narrow it down and confirm it as
      "new". This helps Mozilla's engineers learn about it sooner and fix it
      faster.

    <p>
      Would you like to add "canconfirm" permissions to your account?
