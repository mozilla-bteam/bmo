%]
[% USE date %]

<p><b>Last Updated:</b> [% date.format(template.modtime, "%d-%b-%Y %H:%M %Z") %]</p>

<p>On Friday, July 9, 2010, at 11:40pm PDT (0640 UTC), bugzilla.mozilla.org was
  <a href="[% basepath FILTER none %]show_bug.cgi?id=558044">upgraded</a> to Bugzilla 3.6.1+.  Please
  <a href="[% basepath FILTER none %]enter_bug.cgi?product=mozilla.org&amp;component=Bugzilla:+Other+b.m.o+Issues&amp;blocked=bmo-regressions">file
  any regressions</a> for tracking purposes.</p>

<h3>Known Issues</h3>

<p>The following is a list of issues which are known to be broken or incomplete with this upgrade so far.</p>

<ul>

<li>The <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/showdependencytree.cgi?id=577801&hide_resolved=1">stuff filed in Bugzilla</a>.</li>

</ul>

<h3>What's New</h3>

<h4>Custom bugzilla.mozilla.org Changes</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Addition of autocomplete support for all user-related fields (assignee,
    QA contact, and CC list) and the keywords field.</li>
  <li>New attachment details UI.</li>
  <li>New icons for the front page.</li>
  <li>Removal of unused "Patches" column from buglist.</li>
  <li>Initial support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security">Strict-Transport-Security</a> (STS) header.</li>
</ul>

<h4>General Usability Improvements</h4>

<p>A <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:CMU_HCI_Research_2008">scientific
  usability study</a> was done on [% terms.Bugzilla %] by researchers
  from Carnegie-Mellon University. As a result of this study,
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/showdependencytree.cgi?id=490786&amp;hide_resolved=0">several
  usability issues</a> were prioritized to be fixed, based on specific data
  from the study.</p>

<p>As a result, you will see many small improvements in [% terms.Bugzilla %]'s
  usability, such as using Javascript to validate certain forms before
  they are submitted, standardizing the words that we use in the user interface,
  being clearer about what [% terms.Bugzilla %] needs from the user,
  and other changes, all of which are also listed individually in this New
  Features section.</p>

<p>Work continues on improving usability for the next release of
  [%+ terms.Bugzilla %], but the results of the research have already
  had an impact on this 3.6 release.</p>

<h4>Improved Quicksearch</h4>

<p>The "quicksearch" box that appears on the front page of
  [%+ terms.Bugzilla %] and in the header/footer of every page
  is now simplified and made more powerful. There is a
  <kbd>[?]</kbd> link next to the box that will take you to
  the simplified <a href="[% basepath FILTER none %]page.cgi?id=quicksearch.html">Quicksearch Help</a>,
  which describes every single feature of the system in a simple layout,
  including new features such as the ability to use partial field names
  when searching.</p>

<p>Quicksearch should also be much faster than it was before, particularly
  on large installations.</p>

<p>Note that in order to implement the new quicksearch, certain old
  and rarely-used features had to be removed:

<ul>
  <li><b>+</b> as a prefix to mean "search additional resolutions", and
    <b>+</b> as a prefix to mean "search just the summary". You can
    instead use <kbd>summary:</kbd> to explicitly search summaries.</li>
  <li>Searching the Severity field if you type something that matches
    the first few characters of a severity. You can explicitly search
    the Severity field if you want to find [% terms.bugs %] by severity.</li>
  <li>Searching the Priority field if you typed something that exactly
    matched the name of a priority. You can explicitly search the
    Priority field if you want to find [% terms.bugs %] by priority.</li>
  <li>Searching the Platform and OS fields if you typed in one of a
    certain hard-coded list of strings (like "pc", "windows", etc.).
    You can explicitly search these fields, instead, if you want to
    find [% terms.bugs %] with a specific Platform or OS set.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Simple "Browse" Interface</h4>

<p>There is now a "Browse" link in the header of each [% terms.Bugzilla %]
  page that presents a very basic interface that allows users to simply
  browse through all open [% terms.bugs %] in particular components.</p>

<h4>JSON-RPC Interface</h4>

<p>[% terms.Bugzilla %] now has support for the
  <a href="http://json-rpc.org/">JSON-RPC</a> WebServices protocol via
  <a href="[% docs_urlbase FILTER html %]api/Bugzilla/WebService/Server/JSONRPC.html">jsonrpc.cgi</a>.
  The JSON-RPC interface is experimental in this release--if you want any
  fundamental changes in how it works,
  <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/developers/reporting_bugs.html">let us
  know</a>, for the next release of [% terms.Bugzilla %].</p>

<h3>New Features</h3>

<h4>Enhancements for Users</h4>

<ul>
  <li><b>[% terms.Bug %] Filing:</b> When filing [% terms.abug %],
    [%+ terms.Bugzilla %] now visually indicates which fields are
    mandatory.</li>
  <li><b>[% terms.Bug %] Filing:</b> "Bookmarkable templates" now
    support the "alias" and "estimated hours" fields.</li>

  <li><b>[% terms.Bug %] Editing:</b> In previous versions of
    [%+ terms.Bugzilla %], if you added a private comment to [% terms.abug %],
    then <em>none</em> of the changes that you made at that time were
    sent to users who couldn't see the private comment. Now, for users
    who can't see private comments, public changes are sent, but the private
    comment is excluded from their email notification.</li>
  <li><b>[% terms.Bug %] Editing:</b> The controls for groups now
    appear to the right of the attachment and time-tracking tables,
    when editing [% terms.abug %].</li>
  <li><b>[% terms.Bug %] Editing:</b> The "Collapse All Comments"
    and "Expand All Comments" links now appear to the right of the
    comment list instead of above it.</li>
  <li><b>[% terms.Bug %] Editing:</b> The See Also field now supports
    URLs for Google Code Issues and the Debian B[% %]ug-Tracking System.</li>
  <li><b>[% terms.Bug %] Editing:</b> There have been significant performance
    improvements in <kbd>show_bug.cgi</kbd> (the script that displays the
    [% terms.bug %]-editing form), particularly for [% terms.bugs %] that
    have lots of comments or attachments.</li>

  <li><b>Attachments:</b> The "Details" page of an attachment
    now displays itself as uneditable if you can't edit the fields
    there.</li>
  <li><b>Attachments:</b> We now make sure that there is
    a Description specified for an attachment, using JavaScript, before
    the form is submitted.</li>
  <li><b>Attachments:</b> There is now a link back to the [% terms.bug %]
    at the bottom of the "Details" page for an attachment.</li>
  <li><b>Attachments:</b> When you click on an "attachment 12345" link
    in a comment, if the attachment is a patch, you will now see the
    formatted "Diff" view instead of the raw patch.</li>
  <li><b>Attachments</b>: For text attachments, we now let the browser
    auto-detect the character encoding, instead of forcing the browser to
    always assume the attachment is in UTF-8.</li>

  <li><b>Search:</b> You can now display [% terms.bug %] flags as a column
    in search results.</li>
  <li><b>Search:</b> When viewing search results, you can see which columns are
    being sorted on, and which direction the sort is on, as indicated
    by arrows next to the column headers.</li>
  <li><b>Search:</b> You can now search the Deadline field using relative
    dates (like "1d", "2w", etc.).</li>
  <li><b>Search:</b> The iCalendar format of search results now includes
    a PRIORITY field.</li>
  <li><b>Search:</b> It is no longer an error to enter an invalid search
    order in a search URL--[% terms.Bugzilla %] will simply warn you that
    some of your order options are invalid.</li>
  <li><b>Search:</b> When there are no search results, some helpful
    links are displayed, offering actions you might want to take.</li>
  <li><b>Search:</b> For those who like to make their own
    <kbd>buglist.cgi</kbd> URLs (and for people working on customizations),
    <kbd>buglist.cgi</kbd> now accepts nearly every valid field in
    [%+ terms.Bugzilla %] as a direct URL parameter, like
    <kbd>&amp;field=value</kbd>.</li>

  <li><b>Requests:</b> When viewing the "My Requests" page, you can now
    see the lists as a normal search result by clicking a link at the
    bottom of each table.</li>
  <li><b>Requests:</b> When viewing the "My Requests" page, if you are
    using Classifications, the Product drop-down will be grouped by
    Classification.</li>

  <li>If there are multiple languages available for your
    [%+ terms.Bugzilla %], you can now select what language you want
    [%+ terms.Bugzilla %] displayed in using links at the top of every
    page.</li>
  <li>When creating a new account, you will be automatically logged in
    after setting your password.</li>
  <li>There is no longer a maximum password length for accounts.</li>
  <li>In the Dusk skin, it's now easier to see links.</li>
  <li>In the Whining system, you can now choose to receive emails even
    if there are no [% terms.bugs %] that match your searches.</li>
  <li>The arrows in dependency graphs now point the other way, so that
    [%+ terms.bugs %] point at their dependencies.</li>

  <li><b>New Charts:</b> You can now convert an existing Saved Search
    into a data series for New Charts.</li>
  <li><b>New Charts:</b> There is now an interface that allows you to
    delete data series.</li>
  <li><b>New Charts:</b> When deleting a product, you now have the option
    to delete the data series that are associated with that product.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Enhancements for Administrators and Developers</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Depending on how your workflow is set up, it is now possible to
    have both UNCONFIRMED and REOPENED show up as status choices for
    a closed [% terms.bug %]. If you only want one or the other to
    show up, you should edit your status workflow appropriately
    (possibly by removing or disabling the REOPENED status).</li>
  <li>You can now "disable" field values so that they don't show
    up as choices on [% terms.abug %] unless they are already set as
    the value for that [% terms.bug %]. This doesn't work for the
    per-product field values (component, target_milestone, and version)
    yet, though.</li>
  <li>Users are now locked out of their accounts for 30 minutes after
    trying five bad passwords in a row during login. Every time a
    user is locked out like this, the user in the "maintainer" parameter
    will get an email.</li>
  <li>The minimum length allowed for a password is now 6 characters.</li>
  <li>The <kbd>UNCONFIRMED</kbd> status being enabled in a product
    is now unrelated to the voting parameters. Instead, there is a checkbox
    to enable the <kbd>UNCONFIRMED</kbd> status in a product.</li>
  <li>Information about duplicates is now stored in the database instead
    of being stored in the <kbd>data/</kbd> directory. On large installations
    this could save several hundred megabytes of disk space.</li>

  <li>When editing a group, you can now specify that members of a group
    are allowed to grant others membership in that group itself.</li>
  <li>The ability to compress BMP attachments to PNGs is now an Extension.
    To enable the feature, remove the file
    <kbd>extensions/BmpConvert/disabled</kbd> and then run checksetup.pl.</li>
  <li>The default list of values for the Priority field are now clear English
    words instead of P1, P2, etc.</li>
  <li><kbd>config.cgi</kbd> now returns an ETag header and understands
    the If-None-Match header in HTTP requests.</li>
  <li>The XML format of <kbd>show_bug.cgi</kbd> now returns more information:
    the numeric id of each comment, whether an attachment is a URL,
    the modification time of an attachment, the numeric id of a flag,
    and the numeric id of a flag's type.</li>
</ul>

<h4>WebService Changes</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The WebService now returns all dates and times in the UTC timezone.
    <kbd>B[% %]ugzilla.time</kbd> now acts as though the [% terms.Bugzilla %]
    server were in the UTC timezone, always. If you want to write clients
    that are compatible across all [% terms.Bugzilla %] versions,
    check the timezone from <kbd>B[% %]ugzilla.timezone</kbd> or
    <kbd>B[% %]ugzilla.time</kbd>, and always input times in that timezone
    and expect times to be returned in that format.</li>
  <li>You can now log in by passing <kbd>Bugzilla_login</kbd> and
    <kbd>Bugzilla_password</kbd> as arguments to any WebService function.
    See the
    <a href="[% docs_urlbase FILTER html %]api/Bugzilla/WebService.html#LOGGING_IN">Bugzilla::WebService</a>
    documentation for details.</li>
  <li>New Method:
    <a href="[% docs_urlbase FILTER html %]api/Bugzilla/WebService/Bug.html#attachments">B[% %]ug.attachments</a>
    which allows getting information about attachments.</li>
  <li>New Method:
    <a href="[% docs_urlbase FILTER html %]api/Bugzilla/WebService/Bug.html#fields">B[% %]ug.fields</a>,
    which gets information about all the fields that [% terms.abug %] can have
    in [% terms.Bugzilla %], include custom fields and legal values for
    all fields. The <kbd>B[% %]ug.legal_values</kbd> method is now deprecated.</li>
  <li>In the <kbd>B[% %]ug.add_comment</kbd> method, the "private" parameter
    has been renamed to "is_private" (for consistency with other methods).
    You can still use "private", though, for backwards-compatibility.</li>
  <li>The WebService now has Perl's "taint mode" turned on. This means that
    it validates all data passed in before sending it to the database.
    Also, all parameter names are validated, and if you pass in a parameter
    whose name contains anything other than letters, numbers, or underscores,
    that parameter will be ignored. Mostly this just affects
    customizers--[% terms.Bugzilla %]'s WebService is not functionally
    affected by these changes.</li>
  <li>In previous versions of [% terms.Bugzilla %], error messages were
    sent word-wrapped to the client, from the WebService. Error messages
    are now sent as one unbroken line.</li>
</ul>
