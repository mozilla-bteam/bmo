<h3>How to apply for upgraded permissions</h3>

<p>
  If you want <kbd>canconfirm</kbd>, you can add it yourself using
  the <a href="page.cgi?id=triage_request.html">triage request form</a>.
</p>

<p>
  If you want <kbd>editbugs</kbd>, email <a href="mailto:bmo-perms@mozilla.org">
  bmo-perms@mozilla.org</a> either:
  <ul>
    <li>
      The URLs of two [% terms.bugs %] to which you have attached patches
      or testcases; or
    </li>
    <li>
      The URLs of the relevant comment on three [% terms.bugs %] which you
      wanted to change, but couldn't, and so added a comment instead.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  <kbd>editbugs</kbd> implies <kbd>canconfirm</kbd>; there's no need to apply for both.
</p>

<p>
  Don't forget to include your [% terms.Bugzilla %] ID if it's not the email address
  you are emailing from.
