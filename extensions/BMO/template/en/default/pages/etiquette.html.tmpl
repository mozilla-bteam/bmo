<h1>Bugzilla Etiquette</h1>

<p>
  It is our intention that [% terms.Bugzilla %] remain a useful tool for reporting
  and commenting on [% terms.bugs %], feature requests, and tasks for the Mozilla community.
  <i>No single contributor's work outweighs the importance of civility and professionalism
  in the Mozilla community.</i>
</p>

<p>
  In order to keep [%+ terms.Bugzilla %] a useful, inclusive place we have
  guidelines which, by using this site, you agree to follow.
  In addition, your participation on this site is also subject to the
  <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/participation">Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Violations of [% terms.Bugzilla %] Etiquette or the Mozilla Community Participation
  Guidelines are grounds for curtailing your privileges on this site, or suspending
  your account altogether.
</p>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<h3>Commenting</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <span class="heading">No abusing people</span>.
    Constant and intense critique is one of the reasons we build great products.
    It's harder to fall into group-think if there is always a healthy amount of
    dissent. We want to encourage vibrant debate inside of the Mozilla
    community, we want you to disagree with us, and we want you to effectively
    argue your case. However, we require that in the process, you criticize
    <i>things</i>, not <i>people</i>. Examples of things include: interfaces,
    algorithms, and schedules. Examples of people include: developers,
    designers, and users. <b>Attacking or encouraging attacks on a person
    may result in you being banned from [% terms.Bugzilla %]</b>.
  </li>

  <li>
    <span class="heading">No obligation</span>.
    "Open Source" is not the same as "the developers must do my bidding."
    Everyone here wants to help, but no one else has any <i>obligation</i> to fix
    the [% terms.bugs %] you want fixed. Therefore, you should not act as if you
    expect someone to fix a [% terms.bug %] by a particular date or release.
    Aggressive or repeated demands will not be received well and will almost
    certainly diminish the impact of and interest in your suggestions.
  </li>

  <li>
    <span class="heading">No spam</span>.
    Posting comment spam will lead to the suspension of your account.
  </li>

  <li>
    <span class="heading">No pointless comments</span>.
    Limit comments on a [% terms.bug %] to information which will help with
    resolving it. Unless requested, additional "I see this too" or "It works for me"
    comments are unnecessary. Constructive conversations unrelated to the topic of
    the [% terms.bug %] should go in the appropriate
     <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/about/forums/">discussion forum</a>.
  </li>

  <li>
    <span class="heading">No private email</span>.
    Do not send comments on [% terms.bugs %] by private email to users;
    no one else can read them if you do that, and they'll be missed and/or ignored.
    If an attachment is too big for [% terms.Bugzilla %], add a comment
    giving the file size and contents and ask what to do.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Changing Fields</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <span class="heading">No messing with other people's [% terms.bugs %]</span>.
    Unless you are the [% terms.bug %] assignee, or have some say over the use of their
    time, never change the Priority or Target Milestone fields. If in doubt,
    do not change the fields of [% terms.bugs %] you do not own â€” add a comment
    instead, suggesting the change.
  </li>

  <li>
    <span class="heading">No whining about decisions</span>.
    If another project contributor has marked a [% terms.bug %] as INVALID, then it is
    invalid. Filing another duplicate of it does not change this. Unless you have
    further evidence to support reopening a [% terms.bug %], do not post a comment
    arguing that a [% terms.bug %] resolved as INVALID or WONTFIX should be reopened.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Responding to Violations</h2>

<p>
  If you find a [% terms.Bugzilla %] user violating the [% terms.Bugzilla %] Etiquette
  or the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/participation/">Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines</a>
  in comments on [% terms.bugs %], please <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/BMO/comment_tagging">tag the comments</a>
  in question so that an administrator can review them.
<p>

<p>
  If a comment is abusive or threatening use the tag <b><i>abuse</i></b>. An admin will
  receive a notification shortly and be able to follow up. [% terms.Bugs %] with
  comments marked, 'offtopic', 'spam', and 'advocacy' will also be reviewed.
</p>

<p>
  If you think a comment may violate our policies, but your are not sure how to mark it,
  tag the comment <b><i>admin</i></b> and a moderator will review it.
</p>

<p>
  If a [% terms.bug %]'s short-description, whiteboard tags, attachments,
  or user-created content other than comments that violate the
  <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/participation/">Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines</a>
  or [% terms.Bugzilla %] Etiquette, please describe the issue
  in a comment and tag that comment <b><i>admin</i></b>.
</p>

<p>
  If you cannot tag comments (which requires
  <a href="[% basepath FILTER none %]page.cgi?id=get_permissions.html"><code>editbugs</code> privileges</a>,)
  or if you need to contact a [% terms.Bugzilla %] community administrator urgently:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Send email to <a href="mailto:bmo-mods@mozilla.com">bmo-mods@mozilla.com</a> with
    the [% terms.bug %] number and a short description of the situation.
  </li>

  <li>
    If you have IRC you may also contact the on-duty staff member in the #bmo channel on irc.mozilla.org.
    The on-duty staff member's IRC handle is in the channel's topic.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  If the content of a user's name field contains abusive or offensive content,
  contact a moderator at
  <a href="mailto:bmo-mods@mozilla.com">bmo-mods@mozilla.com</a>.
