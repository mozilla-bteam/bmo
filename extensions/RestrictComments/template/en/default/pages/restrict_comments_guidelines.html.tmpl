<h3>Restricting Comments</h3>

<p>
  Some [% terms.bug %] reports are inundated with comments that make it
  difficult for developers to conduct technical discussions. Restricting
  comments provides the ability for users in the
  [%+ Param('restrict_comments_enable_group') FILTER html %] group to prevent
  users who are not in the [% Param('restrict_comments_group') FILTER html %]
  from making additional comments.
</p>

<h3>Guidelines</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Restrictions may be applied to [% terms.bugs %] which are subject to high
    volumes of off topic comments, or [% terms.bugs %] which contain high volumes
    of violations of [% terms.Bugzilla %]
    <a href="[% basepath FILTER none %]page.cgi?id=etiquette.html">etiquette guidelines</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Restrictions should not be used as a preemptive measure against comments
    which have not yet occurred.
  </li>
  <li>
    Restrictions should not be used to privilege
    [%+ Param('restrict_comments_group') FILTER html %] users over other users
    in valid disputes/discussions.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Impact</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Users who are not in the [% Param('restrict_comments_group') FILTER html %]
    group will not be able to comment on the [% terms.bug %], nor will they be
    able to change the value of any field.
  </li>
  <li>
    All users will still be able to CC themselves to the [% terms.bug %].
  </li>
  <li>
    All users will still be able to vote for the [% terms.bug %].
  </li>
</ul>
