[% IF message_tag == "sitemap_fixing_robots" %]
  Replacing [% current FILTER html %]. (The old version will be saved
  as "[% backup FILTER html %]". You can delete the old version if you
  do not need its contents.)

[% ELSIF message_tag == "sitemap_requirelogin" %]
  Not updating search engines with your sitemap, because you have the
  "requirelogin" parameter turned on, and so search engines will not be
  able to access your sitemap.

[% ELSIF message_tag == "sitemap_no_urlbase" %]
  You have not yet set the "urlbase" parameter. We cannot update
  search engines and inform them about your sitemap without a
  urlbase. Please set the "urlbase" parameter and re-run
  checksetup.pl.

[% END %]
