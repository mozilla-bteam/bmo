search.t - Test L<Bugzilla::Search>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This test tests L<Bugzilla::Search>.

Note that users may be prevented from writing new bugs, products, components,
etc. to your database while this test is running.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item --long

Run AND and OR tests in addition to normal tests. Specifying
--long without also specifying L</--top-operators> is likely to
run your system out of memory.

=item --add-custom-fields

This adds every type of custom field to the database, so that they can
all be tested. Note that this B<CANNOT BE REVERSED>, so do not use this
switch on a production installation.

=item --operators=a,b,c

Limit the test to testing only the listed operators.

=item --top-operators=a,b,c

Limit the top-level tested operators to the following list. This
means that for normal tests, only the listed operators will be tested.
However, for OR and AND tests, all other operators will be tested
along with the operators you listed.

=item --help

Display this help.
