        This method can throw all the same errors as [Get
        Bug](#tag/Bugs/paths/~1bug~1{id_or_alias}/get). In addition, it can also
        throw the following errors:


        * 110 (Comment Is Private)
          You specified the id of a private comment in the "comment_ids"
          argument, and you are not in the "insider group" that can see
          private comments.
        * 111 (Invalid Comment ID)
          You specified an id in the "comment_ids" argument that is invalid--either
          you specified something that wasn't a number, or there is no comment with
          that id.
