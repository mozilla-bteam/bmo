      This is exactly same as the ``time`` key. Use this field instead of
      ``time`` for consistency with other methods including [Get
      Bug](#tag/Bugs/paths/~1bug~1{id_or_alias}/get) and [Get
      Attachment](#tag/Attachments/paths/~1bug~1attachment~1{attachment_id}/get).


      For compatibility, ``time`` is still usable. However, please note that
      ``time`` may be deprecated and removed in a future release.
