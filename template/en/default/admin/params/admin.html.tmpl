This parameter is a json object. It has one or more valid keys, whose values are each of an array [MAX_RATE, SECONDS]. MAX_RATE is the maximum
number of requests that can occur over SECONDS. The default is [75, 60] or 75 requests
over 60 seconds. Valid keys are <code>get_b[%''%]ug</code> which covers JSONRPC, XMLRPC, REST and BZAPI single
[% terms.bug %] access methods, and <code>show_b[%''%]ug</code> which controls show [% terms.bug %]
