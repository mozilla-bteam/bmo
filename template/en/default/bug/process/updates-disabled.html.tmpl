<h1>[% terms.Bug %] Updates Temporarily Suspended</h1>

<p>
We are currently adding a field to [% terms.Bugzilla %].  This requires us to
prevent updates to [% terms.bugs %] for the duration of the database schema
change to add the field (usually 3 to 5 minutes).
</p>

<p>
<b>You should be able to leave this page open, wait a minute or two, then hit
reload or refresh in your browser</b> (and OK any request to re-send the form
data) to complete your [% terms.bug %] change.  Once this maintenance is
complete, your change will succeed and you won't get this page any more.
</p>

<p>
Only updates to [% terms.bugs %] are being blocked by this page, any other
activities in [% terms.Bugzilla %] are still fair game. <a href="[% basepath FILTER none %]index.cgi"
target="_blank">Open [% terms.Bugzilla %] in a new tab/window</a> if you'd
like, to continue working on other things while waiting.
