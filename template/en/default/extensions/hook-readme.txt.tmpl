Template hooks go in this directory. Template hooks are called in normal
[%+ terms.Bugzilla %] templates like [[% '%' %] Hook.process('some-hook') %].
More information about them can be found in the documentation of
B[% %]ugzilla::Extension. (Do "perldoc B[% %]ugzilla::Extension" from the main
[%+ terms.Bugzilla %] directory to see that documentation.)
