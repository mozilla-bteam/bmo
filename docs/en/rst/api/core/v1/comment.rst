.. _rest_comments:

Get Comments
------------

This allows you to get data about comments, given a bug ID or comment ID.

**Request**

To get all comments for a particular bug using the bug ID or alias:

.. code-block:: text

   GET /rest/bug/(id_or_alias)/comment

To get a specific comment based on the comment ID:

.. code-block:: text

   GET /rest/bug/comment/(comment_id)

===============  ========  ======================================================
name             type      description
===============  ========  ======================================================
**id_or_alias**  mixed     A single integer bug ID or alias.
**comment_id**   int       A single integer comment ID.
new_since        datetime  If specified, the method will only return comments
                           *newer* than this time. This only affects comments
                           returned from the ``ids`` argument. You will always be
                           returned all comments you request in the
                           ``comment_ids`` argument, even if they are older than
                           this date.
include_fields   array     Pass ``_collapsed_comments`` to include comments that
                           are collapsed in the web UI (see below). As with the
                           other underscore-prefixed values it does not imply
                           ``_default``, so use
                           ``include_fields=_default,_collapsed_comments`` to get
                           the usual comment fields as well.
skip_private     boolean   If true, inaccessible or invalid bugs are omitted
                           instead of causing an error. This parameter is
                           experimental.
===============  ========  ======================================================

Comments that are collapsed in the web UI -- those tagged with one of the tags
listed in the ``collapsed_comment_tags`` parameter (``spam``, ``abusive``, etc),
and those authored by treeherder -- are left out of the comments returned for a
bug entirely unless ``_collapsed_comments`` is requested. Comments requested by
``comment_id`` are always returned, collapsed or not.

**Response**

.. code-block:: js

   {
     "bugs": {
       "35": {
         "comments": [
           {
             "time": "2000-07-25T13:50:04Z",
             "text": "test bug to fix problem in removing from cc list.",
             "raw_text": "test bug to fix problem in removing from cc list.",
             "bug_id": 35,
             "count": 0,
             "attachment_id": null,
             "is_private": false,
             "tags": [],
             "collapsed": false,
             "creator": "user@bugzilla.org",
             "author": "user@bugzilla.org",
             "creation_time": "2000-07-25T13:50:04Z",
             "reactions": {
              "+1": 3,
              "heart": 2,
              "tada": 1
             },
             "id": 75
           }
         ]
       }
     },
     "comments": {}
   }

This example assumes comment tagging and comment reactions are enabled.

Two items are returned:

``bugs`` This is used for bugs specified in ``ids``. This is an object,
where the keys are the numeric IDs of the bugs, and the value is
an object with a single key, ``comments``, which is an array of comments.
(The format of comments is described below.)

Any individual bug will only be returned once, so if you specify an ID
multiple times in ``ids``, it will still only be returned once.

``comments`` Each individual comment requested in ``comment_ids`` is
returned here, in an object where the numeric comment ID is the key,
and the value is the comment. (The format of comments is described below.)

A "comment" as described above is an object that contains the following items:

================  ========  =====================================================
name              type      description
================  ========  =====================================================
id                int       The globally unique ID for the comment.
bug_id            int       The ID of the bug that this comment is on.
attachment_id     int       If the comment was made on an attachment, this will
                            be the ID of that attachment. Otherwise it will be
                            null.
count             int       The number of the comment local to the bug. The
                            description is comment 0; subsequent comments start
                            with 1.
text              string    The body of the comment, including any special text
                            (such as "this bug was marked as a duplicate of...").
raw_text          string    The body of the comment without any special
                            additional text.
creator           string    The login name of the comment's author.
author            string    A backwards-compatible alias for ``creator``. New
                            clients should use ``creator``.
tags              array     Tags attached to the comment. Only present when
                            comment tagging is enabled.
time              datetime  The time in UTC that the comment was added.
creation_time     datetime  This is exactly same as the ``time`` key. Use this
                            field instead of ``time`` for consistency with other
                            methods including :ref:`rest_single_bug` and
                            :ref:`rest_attachments`.

                            For compatibility, ``time`` is still usable.
                            However, please note that ``time`` may be deprecated
                            and removed in a future release.

is_private        boolean   ``true`` if this comment is private (only visible to
                            a certain group called the "insidergroup"),
                            ``false`` otherwise.
edit_count        int       The number of times this comment has been edited.
                            ``0`` if the comment has never been edited.

                            Only present for users who are allowed to edit other
                            people's comments. Revisions hidden by an
                            edit-comments admin are only counted for members of
                            the edit-comments admins group.

last_change_time  datetime  The time in UTC of the most recent
                            edit to this comment, or null if the comment has
                            never been edited.

                            Only present for users who are allowed to edit other
                            people's comments, and follows the same rules as
                            ``edit_count`` for hidden revisions.

reactions         object    An object containing reacted emoji names and
                            corresponding counts. To retrieve reacted users, use
                            :ref:`rest_get_comment_reactions`. Only present when
                            comment reactions are enabled.
collapsed         boolean   ``true`` if this comment is collapsed in the web UI,
                            either because one of its tags is listed in the
                            ``collapsed_comment_tags`` parameter or because it was
                            authored by treeherder. ``false`` otherwise.

                            Only present when comment tagging is enabled.
================  ========  =====================================================

**Errors**

This method can throw all the same errors as :ref:`rest_single_bug`. In addition,
it can also throw the following errors:

* 110 (Comment Is Private)
  You specified the id of a private comment in the "comment_ids"
  argument, and you are not in the "insider group" that can see
  private comments.
* 111 (Invalid Comment ID)
  You specified an id in the "comment_ids" argument that is invalid--either
  you specified something that wasn't a number, or there is no comment with
  that id.
