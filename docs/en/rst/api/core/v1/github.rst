============

Pull Requests
-------------

This API endpoint is for creating attachments in a bug that are redirect links to a
specific Github pull request. This allows a bug viewer to click on the Github link
and be automatically redirected to the pull request.

**Github Setup Instructions**

* From the repository main page, click on the Settings tab.
* Click on Webhooks from the left side menu.
* Click on the Add Webhook button near the top right.
* For the payload url, enter ``https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/rest/github/pull_request``.
* Choose ``application/json`` for the content type.
* You will need to enter the signature secret obtained from a BMO admin (DO NOT SHARE).
* Make sure Enable SSL is turned on.
* Select "Let me select individual events" and only enable changes for "Pull Requests".
* Make sure at the bottom that "Active" is checked on.
* Save the webhook.

.. note::
  Past pull requests will not automatically get a link created in the bug. New pull
  requests should get the link automatically when the pull request is first created.

.. note:: 
  The API endpoint looks at the pull request title for the bug id so
  make sure the title is formatted correctly to allow the bug id to be determined.
  Examples are: ``Bug 1234:``, ``Bug - 1234``, ``bug 1234``, or ``Bug 1234 -``.

**Request**

The endpoint will error for any requests that do not have ``X-GitHub-Event`` header with
either the value ``pull_request`` or ``ping``. Ping events can happen when a webhook is
first created. In that case, Bugzilla will return success if the signature checks out.

       "title": "Bug 1234567 - Some really bad bug which should be fixed"

Push Comments
-------------

This API endpoint is for adding comments to a bug when a push is made to a linked
Github repository. The comment will be short and specially formatted using pieces
of information from the full JSON sent to Bugzilla by the push event. If the bug
does not have the keyword ``leave-open`` set, the bug will be resolved as FIXED.
Also, the ``qe-verify`` flag will be set to `+` for the bug. For some specific 
repositories, a Firefox status flag may be set to FIXED.

**Github Setup Instructions**

* From the repository main page, click on the Settings tab.
* Click on Webhooks from the left side menu.
* Click on the Add Webhook button near the top right.
* For the payload url, enter ``https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/rest/github/push_comment``.
* Choose ``application/json`` for the content type.
* You will need to enter the signature secret obtained from a BMO admin (DO NOT SHARE).
* Make sure Enable SSL is turned on.
* Select "Let me select individual events" and only enable changes for "Pushes".
* Make sure at the bottom that "Active" is checked on.
* Save the webhook.

.. note::
  The API endpoint looks at the commit messages for the bug ID so
  make sure the message is formatted correctly to allow the bug ID to be determined.
  Examples are: ``Bug 1234:``, ``Bug - 1234``, ``bug 1234``, or ``Bug 1234 -``.

**Request**

The endpoint will error for any events that do not have ``X-GitHub-Event`` header with
either the value ``push`` or ``ping``. Ping events can happen when a webhook is first
created. In that case, Bugzilla will return success if the signature checks out.
