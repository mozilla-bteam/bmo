Attachments
===========

The Bugzilla API for creating, changing, and getting the details of attachments.

.. _rest_attachments:

Get Attachment
--------------

This allows you to get data about attachments, given a list of bugs and/or
attachment IDs. Private attachments will only be returned if you are in the
appropriate group or if you are the submitter of the attachment.

**Request**

To get all current attachments for a bug:

.. code-block:: text

   GET /rest/bug/(bug_id)/attachment

To get a specific attachment based on attachment ID:

.. code-block:: text

   GET /rest/bug/attachment/(attachment_id)

One of the below must be specified.

=================  ====  ======================================================
name               type  description
=================  ====  ======================================================
**bug_id**         int   Integer bug ID.
**attachment_id**  int   Integer attachment ID.
=================  ====  ======================================================

**Response**

.. code-block:: js

   {
      "bugs" : {
         "1345" : [
            { (attachment) },
            { (attachment) }
         ],
         "9874" : [
            { (attachment) },
            { (attachment) }
         ],
      },
      "attachments" : {
         "234" : { (attachment) },
         "123" : { (attachment) },
      }
   }

An object containing two elements: ``bugs`` and ``attachments``.

The attachments for the bug that you specified in the ``bug_id`` argument in
input are returned in ``bugs`` on output. ``bugs`` is a object that has integer
bug IDs for keys and the values are arrays of objects as attachments.
(Fields for attachments are described below.)

For the attachment that you specified directly in ``attachment_id``, they
are returned in ``attachments`` on output. This is a object where the attachment
ids point directly to objects describing the individual attachment.

The fields for each attachment (where it says ``(attachment)`` in the
sample response above) are:

================  ========  =====================================================
name              type      description
================  ========  =====================================================
data              base64    The raw data of the attachment, encoded as Base64.
size              int       The length (in bytes) of the attachment.
creation_time     datetime  The time the attachment was created.
last_change_time  datetime  The last time the attachment was modified.
id                int       The numeric ID of the attachment.
bug_id            int       The numeric ID of the bug that the attachment is
                            attached to.
file_name         string    The file name of the attachment.
summary           string    A short string describing the attachment.
content_type      string    The MIME type of the attachment.
is_private        boolean   ``true`` if the attachment is private (only visible
                            to a certain group called the "insidergroup",
                            ``false`` otherwise.
is_obsolete       boolean   ``true`` if the attachment is obsolete, ``false``
                            otherwise.
is_patch          boolean   ``true`` if the attachment is a patch, ``false``
                            otherwise.
creator           string    The login name of the user that created the
                            attachment.

                            about the flag currently set for each attachment.
                            Each flag object contains items descibed in the
                            Flag object below.
================  ========  =====================================================

Flag object:

=================  ========  ====================================================
name               type      description
=================  ========  ====================================================
id                 int       The ID of the flag.
name               string    The name of the flag.
type_id            int       The type ID of the flag.
creation_date      datetime  The timestamp when this flag was originally created.
modification_date  datetime  The timestamp when the flag was last modified.

                             is only returned if a requestee is set.
=================  ========  ====================================================

**Errors**

This method can throw all the same errors as :ref:`rest_single_bug`. In addition,
it can also throw the following error:

* 304 (Auth Failure, Attachment is Private)
  You specified the id of a private attachment in the "attachment_ids"
  argument, and you are not in the "insider group" that can see
  private attachments.

.. _rest_add_attachment:

-----------------

This allows you to add an attachment to a bug in Bugzilla.

**Request**

To create attachment on a current bug:

.. code-block:: text

   POST /rest/bug/(bug_id)/attachment

.. code-block:: js

   {
     "ids" : [ 35 ],
     "is_patch" : true,
     "comment" : "This is a new attachment comment",
     "summary" : "Test Attachment",
     "content_type" : "text/plain",
     "data" : "(Some base64 encoded content)",
     "file_name" : "test_attachment.patch",
     "obsoletes" : [],
     "is_private" : false,
     "flags" : [
       {
         "name" : "review",
         "status" : "?",
         "requestee" : "user@bugzilla.org",
         "new" : true
       }
     ]
   }


The params to include in the POST body, as well as the returned
data format, are the same as below. The ``bug_id`` param will be
overridden as it it pulled from the URL path.

================  =======  ======================================================
**ids**           array    The IDs or aliases of bugs that you want to add this
                           attachment to. The same attachment and comment will be
                           added to all these bugs.
**data**          base64   The content of the attachment. You must encode it in
                           base64 using an appropriate client library such as
                           ``MIME::Base64`` for Perl.
**file_name**     string   The "file name" that will be displayed in the UI for
                           this attachment and also downloaded copies will be
                           given.
**summary**       string   A short string describing the attachment.

is_patch          boolean  ``true`` if Bugzilla should treat this attachment as a
                           patch. If you specify this, you do not need to specify
                           a ``content_type``. The ``content_type`` of the
                           attachment will be forced to ``text/plain``. Defaults
                           to ``false`` if not specified.
is_private        boolean  ``true`` if the attachment should be private
                           (restricted to the "insidergroup"), ``false`` if the
                           attachment should be public. Defaults to ``false`` if
                           not specified.
flags             array    Flags objects to add to the attachment. The object
                           format is described in the Flag object below.
bug_flags         array    Flag objects to add to the attachment's bug. See the
                           ``flags`` param for :ref:`rest_create_bug` for the
